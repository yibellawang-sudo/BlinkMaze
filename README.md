# BlinkMaze
This is a browser-based puzzle game where the maze walls vanish and reappear on a timer, forcing players to rely on memory, timing, and quick thinking to reach the glowing exit. Along the way, players encounter multiple levels, Glowfruit power-ups, and progressively harder levels. I wanted to create a fun, small-scale browser game that plays with memory and perception. The idea of walls that "blink" in and out of existence was a pretty random idea, but it definitely added an interesting amount of challenge.

It is built with HTML5 and vanilla Javascript, generating the mazes using a recursive backtracking algorithm with a timed blink cycle hides and reveals walls. I also included a timer and best-time tracker to encourage speedrunning. A struggle I met was making sure mazes consistently increased in difficulty while still being solvable, and the solution to it was learning how to and implementing a BFS reachability test to guarantee that the exit could always be reached.
